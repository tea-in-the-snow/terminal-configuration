# terminal-configuration

My own terminal configuration.

## Alacritty

- On Windows, the config file should be located at: %APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml.

- Using win+R the type %APPDATA% to get to the location.

## Wezterm

- On Windows, the config file should be located at: %home%\.wezterm

## zsh

- Need to install Zinit First.

- The config file should be $HOME/.zshrc.

- It is much faster than oh-my-zsh.
